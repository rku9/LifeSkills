Question 1
Which point(s) were new to you?
* I hadnâ€™t really thought about over-communicating small blockers like internet or laptop issues. I usually just 
try to fix them on my own.

Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
* I want to build fluency in the non-coding aspects of software engineering like advanced git and devops stuff
  like docker, jira, aws etc.
* Start with introductory lectures to get acquainted with the concepts and then use them in local projects.
