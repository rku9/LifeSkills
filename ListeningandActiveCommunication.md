#### Q1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)
1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts.
2. Focus on the speaker and the topic.
3. Only respond after the opposite party has finished talking.
4. Use "door openers" to make others feel like you are listening to them 
   and keep the conversation going.
5. Show that you are listening by using body language to make subtle signs.

#### Q2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)
1. Listen not just the words but also make sense of it. This makes it easier to grasp the hidden interests and motivations.
2. To make the opposite party believe that you have understood them correctly, paraphrase in your own words.
3. Check for accuracy so misinterpretations are surfaced quickly and can be clarified without escalation.
4. Acknowledge other's feelings along with the facts in their talk.
5. Make opposite party feel safe so they are more willing to share deeper concerns.
6. Focus on understanding before responding in trying to persuade.

#### Q3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?
Most of the times I try to anticipate what others are saying and there are multiple responses coming into my head and I start 
feeling the need to talk about them as soon as possible otherwise I would lose them.

#### Q4. What can you do to improve your listening?
I can note down the most important things and then try to respond.

#### Q5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?
When I am in a conversation with someone I really care about.

#### Q6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
Very rare. Mostly when I am not having a good day and something bothers me.

#### Q7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?
Apart from gossiping and taunts I am really into the other two. I tend to switch depending on the situations. I use sarcasm when 
I am feeling good and silent treatment when I am focused on some task and someone does something that I don't like.

#### Q8. How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)
