* Active mode of thinking is when the brain is using logical reasoning actively and following a process chain to solve a problem. Whereas the 
  diffused mode is when you encounter a new problem and your brain is trying to find the way to decipher this by making connections to other 
  disciplines.
#### 4. What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
* ##### Deconstruct the skill: 
    Delineate the most important skills needed to get to know something enough and focus on them first.
* ##### Learn enough to self-correct: 
    By doing the above you can accumulate enough knowledge to self correct yourself when you are going in the wrong direction.
* ##### Remove barriers to practice: 
    This is probably the most important step. Remove all the distractions that are there to stop you from practicing.
* ##### Practice for 20 hours: 
    Then actually practice.
#### 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* I would try to reduce as many barriers to the process of practicing as possible.
