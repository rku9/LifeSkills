1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* The idea that the targets don't have to be very ambitious at the start but could be something so small that you don't have to think
  much about it. But as you start that journey adding to that already existing amount is much easier.
2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* M is motivation, A is ability and P is prompt. The fact that a behavior (B) happens when motivation, ability, and a prompt converge at the same moment. If any one of them is missing, 
  the behavior won’t reliably occur. Hence, by making sure those components are in place, we can consistently "behave" in a way we want.
3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
* Because repetition alone would take more amount of time compared to the scenario where we have also factored in the "Emotional" part of celebrating.
4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* Spend 60 seconds today on one focused skill and then add just 1 more minute tomorrow. This mirrors the principle of compounding small gains.
5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
* Framing the habits based on who you are is more durable that the target itself.
6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
* By framing it based on "who you are". As the identity is stable and if your behavior is an expression of who you are, you don’t need much extra willpower. 
7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
* By increasing the cost of a habit we can create friction and this makes something harder to do.
8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying? 
* Spend atleast 2 hours in the morning on codeforces/atcoder every single day like until few months back. 
* For that I need to have my dinner earlier and get to bed earlier.
9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
* Screen time after 8pm.
* I'll try to pick a book.
